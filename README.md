A high-end, dark sci-fi portfolio website featuring a "Void Minimalist" aesthetic with interactive 3D elements.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

## Installation

Since the project was created manually, you need to install the dependencies for both the server and client.

1.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Install Client Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

You need to run both the backend server and the frontend development server.

1.  **Start the Backend:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend:**
    Open a *new* terminal window and run:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will start at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Features
